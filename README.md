# Datastructures and Algorithms

## Intro

This repository is to hold the code I write, while I review and dig deeper into my studies of
Data Structures and Algorithms. Implementations will be written in both JavaScript and Python.

## Algorithms

### Binary Search

Binary Search is a search algorithim which compares the middle element of an array with a target value.
The midpoint then changes on whether the value in the element is greater or lesser than the target value until,
the target is either found or not. Binary Search trees utilize the algoritm in order to find values quickly.

## Data Structures

### Stack

The stack is linear absract data structure base on the the concept of LIFO, last in first out.
